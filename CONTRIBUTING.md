# Contributing to the Community Events Calendar

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  
This project exists to make community events visible and accessible, and we welcome submissions from across the community.

You do **not** need to be a programmer to contribute, but you **do** need a GitHub account.

## What you can contribute

You can contribute by:

- submitting a new event  
- updating details of an existing event  
- flagging an error or issue  
- suggesting improvements via GitHub Issues  

Most contributions take only a few minutes.

## How events are submitted

Events are submitted as **individual files**, one event per file.

Each event:

- is written in a simple text format (YAML)  
- lives in the `_data/events/` folder  
- is reviewed before being published  

Events are **not published automatically** — all submissions go through review.
